# Git branch workflow

**Do not push directly to `main`.** Work on a feature branch and merge into `main` after review (or when ready).

## Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main` (or from latest `main`):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Commit and push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your message"
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Merge into main** (after review, or when ready):
   - Open a Pull Request (GitHub/GitLab) and merge, or
   - Merge locally then push:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git merge your-branch-name
     git push origin main
     ```

## Before pushing

- Run pre-push checks: `npm run check:prepush` (runs lint, test, type-check on changed workspaces).

## Reminder

When suggesting Git commands, prefer commands that push to the **current branch** (e.g. `git push -u origin <current-branch>`) rather than pushing to `main` unless the user is explicitly merging.
