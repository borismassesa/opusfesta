# Mobile Money Payment Flow - Confirmed

## Complete Flow (Step-by-Step)

### ✅ STEP 1: Customer Initiates Payment
**Component:** `MobileMoneyPaymentInstructions.tsx`
- Customer selects "Mobile Money" payment method
- System displays **TheFesta's LIPA NAMBA** (payment code) in digit boxes
- Shows payment instructions with amount
- Example: LIPA NAMBA displayed as individual digit boxes: "5 7 0 2 0 1 5 9"
- Account name: "TheFesta"

### ✅ STEP 2: Customer Makes Payment
**Action:** Customer uses their phone
- Customer dials USSD code for their mobile money provider
- Customer enters **TheFesta's LIPA NAMBA** (payment code)
- Customer enters payment amount
- Payment goes to **TheFesta's mobile money account** (not vendor's)
- Customer receives confirmation SMS from mobile money provider
- Example: "You have sent TZS 1,000,000 to TheFesta"

### ✅ STEP 3: Customer Uploads Receipt
**API:** `POST /api/payments/receipts`
**Component:** `MobileMoneyPaymentInstructions.tsx`

Customer submits:
1. Receipt screenshot/image → Uploaded to Supabase Storage
2. Transaction/receipt number → Stored in `payment_receipts.receipt_number`
3. Phone number → Stored in `payment_receipts.phone_number`
4. Payment date → Stored in `payment_receipts.payment_date`

**Creates:**
- Payment record: `status = 'PENDING'`, `method = 'MPESA'` (or other provider)
- Receipt record: `status = 'pending'`

### ✅ STEP 4: Vendor Verifies Receipt
**API:** `POST /api/payments/receipts/[id]/verify`
**Database Function:** `verify_payment_receipt()`

Vendor reviews:
- Receipt image
- Transaction number
- Amount verification
- Phone number

**If Approved:**
- Receipt status → `'verified'`
- Payment status → `'SUCCEEDED'`
- Payment `processed_at` → Current timestamp
- Payment `provider_ref` → Receipt number

**Database Trigger Fires:**
- `create_escrow_hold_trigger` detects `status = 'SUCCEEDED'`
- Automatically creates escrow hold

### ✅ STEP 5: Escrow Hold Created (AUTOMATIC)
**Database Trigger:** `create_escrow_hold_trigger`
**Function:** `create_escrow_hold()`

**Creates:**
1. **escrow_holds** record:
   ```sql
   total_amount: TZS 1,000,000
   platform_fee: TZS 100,000 (10%)
   vendor_amount: TZS 900,000 (90%)
   status: 'held'
   ```

2. **platform_revenue** record:
   ```sql
   amount: TZS 100,000
   status: 'collected' (immediately available)
   ```

3. **vendor_revenue** record:
   ```sql
   amount: TZS 900,000
   escrow_status: 'held'
   transfer_status: 'pending'
   ```

### ✅ STEP 6: Work Completion
**API:** `POST /api/escrow/[id]/complete-work`
**Database Function:** `mark_work_completed()`

Vendor or customer marks work as completed:
- `work_completed = true`
- `work_completed_at = NOW()`
- `work_verified_by = user_id`

### ✅ STEP 7: Escrow Release (24h after completion)
**API:** `POST /api/escrow/[id]/release`
**Database Function:** `release_escrow_funds()`

After 24 hours (or manual release):
- Escrow status → `'released'`
- Vendor revenue status → `'released'`
- Funds ready for transfer

**Transfer Options:**
1. Stripe Connect (if vendor has account)
2. Bank transfer
3. Mobile money transfer

## ✅ CORRECTED FLOW (No Reconciliation Needed)

### The Solution

**Updated Flow:**
```
Customer pays TZS 1,000,000 → TheFesta's mobile money account (DIRECT)
                                 ↓
                        TheFesta receives full amount
                                 ↓
                        Escrow hold created (TZS 900,000)
                                 ↓
                        ✅ Funds are actually held by TheFesta!
```

**Benefits:** 
- Customer pays directly to TheFesta
- TheFesta receives TZS 1,000,000 in their account
- Escrow hold created automatically (TZS 900,000)
- **No reconciliation needed - funds are already with TheFesta!**

### Complete Flow

```
1. Customer pays TZS 1,000,000 → TheFesta's mobile money ✅
2. Customer uploads receipt
3. Vendor verifies receipt
4. Payment status → SUCCEEDED
5. Escrow hold created (TZS 900,000) - funds already held
6. Work completion
7. Escrow release → Transfer TZS 900,000 to vendor
```

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Working
- [x] Payment record creation (PENDING)
- [x] Receipt upload and storage
- [x] Receipt verification by vendor
- [x] Payment status update to SUCCEEDED
- [x] Escrow hold creation (automatic trigger)
- [x] Work completion tracking
- [x] Escrow release mechanism

### ✅ What's Complete
- [x] **TheFesta mobile money accounts** - Database table created
- [x] **Payment instructions** - Shows TheFesta's LIPA Namba
- [x] **Escrow system** - Funds held automatically
- [x] **No reconciliation needed** - Funds go directly to TheFesta

## Next Steps

1. **Set up TheFesta mobile money accounts** (Admin)
   - Update `platform_mobile_money_accounts` table with actual LIPA NAMBA codes:
     - M-PESA: 57020159 (example - 8 digits)
     - Airtel Money: 12802655 (example - 8 digits)
     - Tigo Pesa: 15050478 (example - 8 digits)
     - Halo Pesa: 12345678 (example - 8 digits)
   - LIPA NAMBA is typically an 8-digit payment code (not a phone number)
   - Mark one as `is_primary = true` for each provider

2. **Admin API** (Optional - for managing accounts)
   - `PUT /api/admin/platform/mobile-money` - Update accounts
   - `POST /api/admin/platform/mobile-money` - Add new account
   - `DELETE /api/admin/platform/mobile-money/[id]` - Deactivate account

## Confirmation

**Current Flow (As Implemented):**
1. ✅ Customer pays **TheFesta** directly (not vendor)
2. ✅ Customer uploads receipt
3. ✅ Vendor verifies receipt
4. ✅ Payment → SUCCEEDED
5. ✅ Escrow hold created automatically (funds already with TheFesta)
6. ✅ Work completion
7. ✅ Escrow release → Transfer to vendor

**The escrow system works perfectly - funds are held by TheFesta from the start!**
