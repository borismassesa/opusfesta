# Escrow Model Comparison & OpusFesta Implementation

## Model Comparison

### Airbnb Model (Escrow-like) ✅
**How it works:**
1. Guest pays Airbnb at booking
2. Airbnb holds the money (not immediately to host)
3. Guest checks in
4. **24 hours after check-in**, Airbnb releases payment to host
5. If problem → Airbnb can pause/adjust payout

**Characteristics:**
- Funds held temporarily
- Release is conditional (successful check-in)
- Dispute resolution exists
- Platform-controlled (not independent escrow)

### Uber Model (Payment Orchestration) ⚠️
**How it works:**
1. Rider's payment authorized at ride request
2. After ride ends, Uber captures payment
3. Uber pays driver later (daily/weekly batches)

**Characteristics:**
- Shorter holding period
- Less conditional checks
- More like payment intermediary
- Faster settlement

### OpusFesta Model (Airbnb-style) ✅
**How it works:**
1. Customer pays OpusFesta at booking/invoice
2. OpusFesta holds the money (not immediately to vendor)
3. Vendor completes work/service
4. Work is verified (vendor/customer/admin)
5. **Funds released** to vendor after verification
6. If problem → OpusFesta can hold/refund

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Funds held temporarily (escrow)
- ✅ Release is conditional (work completion + verification)
- ✅ Dispute resolution capability
- ✅ Platform-controlled (OpusFesta manages rules)
- ✅ 10% platform fee collected immediately
- ✅ 90% vendor amount held until completion

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Airbnb | Uber | OpusFesta |
|--------|--------|------|----------|
| **Holding Period** | Until check-in + 24h | Minimal (post-ride) | Until work completion |
| **Release Trigger** | Check-in + time delay | Ride completion | Work completion + verification |
| **Dispute Handling** | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| **Platform Fee** | ~3% | ~25% | 10% |
| **Vendor Payout** | After check-in | Daily/weekly | After work completion |

## Why Airbnb Model for OpusFesta?

### ✅ Perfect Fit
- **Service-based** (like Airbnb's accommodation service)
- **Quality matters** (work must be completed properly)
- **Customer protection** needed (payment security)
- **Vendor accountability** important (ensure completion)

### ✅ Benefits
1. **Customer Trust**: Payment protected until work done
2. **Quality Assurance**: Vendors motivated to complete work well
3. **Dispute Resolution**: Platform can mediate issues
4. **Platform Control**: OpusFesta manages the process

## Implementation Details

### Current Flow
```
1. Customer Payment → OpusFesta Account (HELD)
2. Platform Fee (10%) → Collected Immediately
3. Vendor Amount (90%) → Held in Escrow
4. Work Completed → Verification
5. Funds Released → Vendor Receives 90%
```

### Release Options

#### Option 1: Automatic Release (Recommended)
- Work marked as completed
- **24-48 hour window** for customer to dispute
- Auto-release if no dispute
- Similar to Airbnb's 24h after check-in

#### Option 2: Manual Release
- Admin reviews work completion
- Admin approves release
- More control, slower process

#### Option 3: Customer Confirmation
- Customer confirms work completed
- Immediate or scheduled release
- Highest customer satisfaction

## Configuration Recommendations

### Default Settings
```typescript
{
  autoReleaseEnabled: true,
  releaseDelayHours: 24, // Like Airbnb's 24h after check-in
  customerConfirmationRequired: false, // Optional
  disputeWindowHours: 48,
  adminReviewThreshold: 10000 // TZS - manual review for large amounts
}
```

### Release Triggers
1. **Work Completed** + **24 hours** → Auto-release
2. **Work Completed** + **Customer Confirms** → Immediate release
3. **Work Completed** + **Admin Approves** → Manual release
4. **Dispute Opened** → Hold funds until resolved

## Dispute Handling

### Dispute Flow
1. Customer opens dispute
2. Funds held in escrow
3. Admin reviews dispute
4. Resolution:
   - **Work verified** → Release to vendor
   - **Work incomplete** → Refund to customer
   - **Partial completion** → Split payment

## Advantages Over True Escrow

### ✅ Faster Processing
- No independent escrow service delays
- Platform controls timing
- Better user experience

### ✅ Lower Costs
- No escrow service fees
- Platform manages internally
- More cost-effective

### ✅ Better Control

2. **Add Dispute System**: Customer can open disputes
3. **Customer Confirmation**: Optional customer approval
4. **Notifications**: Alert vendors when funds ready
